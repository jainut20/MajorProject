7. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME when the algorithm analyzes: (()(())(()))?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 3 elements are there in stack before right parentheses comes. Therefore, maximum number of elements in stack at run time is 3.




8. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. Suppose that you run the algorithm on a sequence that contains 2 left parentheses and 3 right parentheses (in some order). The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME during the computation?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 2 left parenthesis are pushed whereas one right parenthesis removes one of left parenthesis. 2 elements are there before right parenthesis which is the maximum number of elements in stack at run time.

9. What is the value of the postfix expression 6 3 2 4 + � *?

a) difficulty in knowing children nodes of a node
b) difficult in finding the parent of a node
c) have to know the maximum number of nodes possible before creation of trees
d) difficult to implement
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The size of array is fixed in normal arrays. We need to know the number of nodes in the tree before array declaration. It is the main disadvantage of using arrays to represent binary trees.

3. What must be the ideal size of array if the height of tree is �l�?
a) 2l-1
b) l-1
c) l
d) 2l
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Maximum elements in a tree (complete binary tree in worst case) of height �L� is 2L-1. Hence size of array is taken as 2L-1.

4. What are the children for node �w� of a complete-binary tree in an array representation?
a) 2w and 2w+1
b) 2+w and 2-w
c) w+1/2 and w/2
d) w-1/2 and w+1/2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The left child is generally taken as 2*w whereas the right child will be taken as 2*w+1 because root node is present at index 0 in the array and to access every index position in the array.

5. What is the parent for a node �w� of a complete binary tree in an array representation when w is not 0?
a) floor(w-1/2)
b) ceil(w-1/2)
c) w-1/2

6. If the tree is not a complete binary tree then what changes can be made for easy access of children of a node in the array?
a) every node stores data saying which of its children exist in the array
b) no need of any changes continue with 2w and 2w+1, if node is at i
c) keep a seperate table telling children of a node
d) use another array parallel to the array with tree
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Array cannot represent arbitrary shaped trees. It can only be used in case of complete trees. If every node stores data saying that which of its children exists in the array then elements can be accessed easily.

7. What must be the missing logic in place of missing lines for finding sum of nodes of binary tree in alternate levels?




  //e.g:-consider -complete binary tree:-height-3, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]-answer must be 23
  {
        //present level is initialized to 1 and sum is initialized to  0
        {
        }
     //missing logic
  }
a)
b)
c)
d)
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The i value must skip through all nodes in the next level and current level must be one+next level.
��
8. Consider a situation of writing a binary tree into a file with memory storage efficiency in mind, is array representation of tree is good?
a) yes because we are overcoming the need of pointers and so space efficiency
b) yes because array values are indexable
c) No it is not efficient in case of sparse trees and remaning cases it is fine
d) No linked list representation of tree is only fine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In case of sparse trees (where one node per level in worst cases), the array size (2h)-1 where h is height but only h indexes will be filled and (2h)-1-h nodes will be left unused leading to space wastage.

9. Why is heap implemented using array representations than tree(linked list) representations though both tree representations and heaps have same complexities?
for binary heap
-insert: O(log n)
-delete min: O(log n)
-insert: O(log n)
-delete: O(log n)
Then why go with array representation when both are having same values ?
a) arrays can store trees which are complete and heaps are not complete
b) lists representation takes more memory hence memory efficiency is less and go with arrays and arrays have better caching
c) lists have better caching
d) In lists insertion and deletion is difficult
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In memory the pointer address for next node may not be adjacent or nearer to each other and also array have wonderful caching power from os and manipulating pointers is a overhead. Heap data structure is always a complete binary tree.

10. Can a tree stored in an array using either one of inorder or post order or pre order traversals be again reformed?
a) Yes just traverse through the array and form the tree
b) No we need one more traversal to form a tree
c) No in case of sparse trees
d) Yes by using both inorder and array elements
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: We need any two traversals for tree formation but if some additional stuff or techniques are used while storing a tree in an array then one traversal can facilitate like also storing null values of a node in array.

1. How the keyword �TYPE� is used?
a) TYPE datatype_name IS type_from_predefined_datatypes;
b) TYPE datatype_name IS datatype_range;
c) TYPE datatype_range IS datatype_name;
d) USE TYPE datatype_range IS datatype_name;
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The keyword TYPE is used to define new data type if any user wants to define for its own. The syntax for keyword is- TYPE datatype_name IS datatype_range. So, the new data type can have the values defined in range section of the declaration.




2. Which of the following is a wrong declaration for a new data type?
a) TYPE my_logic IS RANGE 0 to 100;
b) TYPE my_logic IS (�0�, �1�, �2�);
c) TYPE my_logic IS ARRAY (0 TO 3) OF BIT;
d) TYPE my_logic IS  <0 TO 20 >
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: TYPE can be used in three forms as shown above. For defining range, there are two methods as illustrated in option TYPE my_logic IS RANGE 0 to 100; and option TYPE my_logic IS (�0�, �1�, �2�);. If we want to define a user defined array then the sytanx like option TYPE my_logic IS ARRAY (0 TO 3) OF BIT; follows. But, we can�t define range by using <> sign.

3. One can�t define an array without any constraints in VHDL.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: We can define an array without any constraints in VHDL. When there are no constraints in array then it can have any number of elements. For example, TYPE my_type IS ARRAY (RANGE <>) OF BIT; this declaration defines an array of BIT data type without any constraint on the number of elements in the array.

4. A SUBTYPE can be defined as _________
a) A TYPE under a TYPE (nested)
b) A type of INTEGER datatype
c) A TYPE with some constraint
d) A TYPE without any constraint
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: A SUBTYPE is a TYPE with some constraints. TYPE can be predefined data type and it can also be any user defined data type. But if SUBTYPE is derived from user defined datatype, then we first have to declare the type along with its range and then subtype can be defined.

5. Which of the following is the correct syntax for declaring a SUBTYPE?
a) TYPE type_name IS type_range AND SUBTYPE subtype_name IS subtype_range
b) SUBTYPE subtype_name IS subtype_range TYPE type_name
c) SUBTYPE subtype_name TYPE type_name IS subtype_range
d) SUBTYPE subtype_name IS TYPE subtype_range
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The correct way to define a SUBTYPE is the syntax shown in option d. For example, if we want to define a SUBTYPE of STD_LOGIC with 3 values only like X, 0 and 1. We can define it as SUBTYPE my _ subtype IS STD_LOGIC RANGE �X� TO �1�.

6. Which of the following can�t be the value of x? Refer to the VHDL code given below.
TYPE color IS (red, green, blue, black, white, gray);
SUBTYPE primary IS color RANGE red to blue;
VARIABLE x: primary;
a) White
b) Red
c) Green
d) Blue
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: PRIMARY is a subtype of COLOR as declared in the code. The range of PRIMARY is declared �red� to �blue�. It means that an object of Primary type can have values red, green or blue. So White can�t be assigned to x.




7. Look at the following declarations:




TYPE array1 IS ARRAY ( 0 TO 3 ) OF BIT_VECTOR (3 DOWNTO 0 ); 
TYPE array 2 IS ARRAY ( 0 TO 3 ) OF array1;
How many total bits can be stored in these arrays?
a) 16
b) 9
c) 64
d) 27
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: First of all, array1 is array of BIT_VECTOR type that means it contains 4 BIT_VECTOR. One BIT_VECTOR is here declared to be consisting of 4 bits. Therefore, Array 1 can have 16 bits. Now, array2 is an array of 4 array1. Therefore, total bits are 4 � 16 = 64.

8. Refer to the four declarations below, which of the following is not a 2 dimensional array?
TYPE array1 IS ARRAY ( 3 DOWNTO 0, 1 DOWNTO 0 ) OF STD_LOGIC;
TYPE array2 IS ARRAY (3 DOWNTO 0 ) OF STD_LOGIC_VECTOR( 3 DOWNTO 0 );
TYPE array3 IS ARRAY (2 DOWNTO 0 )  OF array2;
TYPE array4 IS ARRAY ( 0 TO 3, 3 DOWNTO 0 ) OF BIT;
a) array4
b) array3
c) array2
d) array1
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Here, array1 is a 2-D array with 4 rows and 2 columns (3 DOWNTO 0 and 1 DOWNTO 0) of STD_LOGIC type. Though, array2 declaration looks like 1D array, but it is 2D array, since it is of type STD_LOGIC_VECTOR, which is already a 1D array, so array2 is a 2D array. Similarly array4 is 4 � 4 matrix. But, array3 is a 3D array. Because it is 1D array of 2D array named as array2.

9. User can define its own integer data type.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In VHDL, user can define either its own integer type or enumerated type. User defined integer type must always be a subset of predefined datatype. User can define the integer with some desired range. For example, we can define any integer named as my_integer with range 0 to 32 as given: TYPE my_integer IS RANGE 0 TO 32; in this way, one can define a subset of integer.

10. Which of the following is a SUBTYPE of INTEGER?
a) NATURAL
b) REAL
c) CHARACTER
d) STD_LOGIC
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: We can say that NATURAL is a subtype of  INTEGER. The range of NATURAL datatype is 0 to 231-1, whereas the range of INTEGER is � (231-1) to (231-1). Therefore, it can be written as SUBTYPE NATURAL IS INTEGER RANGE 0 TO 2147483647.

a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 3 elements are there in stack before right parentheses comes. Therefore, maximum number of elements in stack at run time is 3.




8. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. Suppose that you run the algorithm on a sequence that contains 2 left parentheses and 3 right parentheses (in some order). The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME during the computation?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 2 left parenthesis are pushed whereas one right parenthesis removes one of left parenthesis. 2 elements are there before right parenthesis which is the maximum number of elements in stack at run time.

d) No linked list representation of tree is only fine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In case of sparse trees (where one node per level in worst cases), the array size (2h)-1 where h is height but only h indexes will be filled and (2h)-1-h nodes will be left unused leading to space wastage.

9. Why is heap implemented using array representations than tree(linked list) representations though both tree representations and heaps have same complexities?
for binary heap
-insert: O(log n)
-delete min: O(log n)
-insert: O(log n)
-delete: O(log n)
Then why go with array representation when both are having same values ?
a) arrays can store trees which are complete and heaps are not complete
b) lists representation takes more memory hence memory efficiency is less and go with arrays and arrays have better caching
c) lists have better caching
d) In lists insertion and deletion is difficult
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In memory the pointer address for next node may not be adjacent or nearer to each other and also array have wonderful caching power from os and manipulating pointers is a overhead. Heap data structure is always a complete binary tree.

10. Can a tree stored in an array using either one of inorder or post order or pre order traversals be again reformed?
a) Yes just traverse through the array and form the tree
b) No we need one more traversal to form a tree
c) No in case of sparse trees
d) Yes by using both inorder and array elements

7. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME when the algorithm analyzes: (()(())(()))?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 3 elements are there in stack before right parentheses comes. Therefore, maximum number of elements in stack at run time is 3.




8. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. Suppose that you run the algorithm on a sequence that contains 2 left parentheses and 3 right parentheses (in some order). The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME during the computation?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 2 left parenthesis are pushed whereas one right parenthesis removes one of left parenthesis. 2 elements are there before right parenthesis which is the maximum number of elements in stack at run time.

9. What is the value of the postfix expression 6 3 2 4 + � *?

c) C++ technique to avoid multiple inheritances of classes
d) C++ technique to avoid multiple copies of the base class into children/derived class
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: Virtual inheritance is a C++ technique with which it ensures that a derived class contains only one copy of the base classs variables. Refer Wikipedia for more info.




10. What happens if the following C++ statement is compiled and executed?
int *ptr = NULL;
delete ptr;
a) The program is not semantically correct
b) The program is compiled and executed successfully
c) The program gives a compile-time error
d) The program compiled successfully but throws an error during run-time
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The above statement is syntactically and semantically correct as C++ allows the programmer to delete a NULL pointer, therefore, the program is compiled and executed successfully.

11. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream> 
#include <string>
using namespace std; 
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
}
a) Hello
b) World
c) Error
d) Hello World
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: There is no operation defined for the addition of character array in C++ hence the compiler throws an error as it does not understood what to do about this expression.




12. What is the difference between delete and delete[] in C++?
a) delete is syntactically correct but delete[] is wrong and hence will give an error if used in any case
b) delete is used to delete normal objects whereas delete[] is used to pointer objects
c) delete is a keyword whereas delete[] is an identifier
d) delete is used to delete single object whereas delete[] is used to multiple(array/pointer of) objects
View AnswerAnswer: d

int main(void) 
{ 
}
a) Error in C and successful execution in C++
b) Error in both C and C++
c) Error in C++ and successful execution in C
d) A successful run in both C and C++
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: new is a keyword in C++, therefore, we cannot declare a variable with name new but as there is no such keyword new in C, therefore, the program is compiled and executed successfully in C.




14. What happens if the following program is executed in C and C++?
#include <stdio.h> 
void func(void)
{
}
void main() 
{ 
}
a) Outputs Hello twice in both C and C++
b) Error in C and successful execution in C++
c) Error in C++ and successful execution in C
d) Error in both C and C++
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: As the func(void) needs no argument during its call, hence when we are calling func(2) with 2 as passed as a parameter then this statement gives the error in both C++ and C compiler.

15. Which of the following is correct about this pointer in C++?
a) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all static variables of a class
b) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all the functions of a class
c) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all non-static functions of a class
d) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all static functions of a class
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: As static functions are a type of global function for a class so all the object shares the common instance of that static function whereas all the objects have there own instance for non-static functions and hence they are passed as a hidden argument in all the non-static members but not in static members.

16. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    #include <string>    #include <algorithm>    using namespace std;    int main()     {        string s = "spaces in text";        s.erase(remove(s.begin(), s.end(), ' ' ), s.end() ) ;        cout << s << endl;    }
a) spacesintext
b) spaces in text
c) spaces
d) spaces in

############## https://www.sanfoundry.com/object-oriented-programming-questions-answers-pointer/
1. Which is the pointer which denotes the object calling the member function?
a) Variable pointer
b) This pointer
c) Null pointer
d) Zero pointer
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The pointer which denotes the object calling the member function is known as this pointer. The this pointer is usually used when there are members in the function with same name as those of the class members.




2. Which among the following is true?
a) this pointer is passed implicitly when member functions are called
b) this pointer is passed explicitly when member functions are called
c) this pointer is passed with help of pointer member functions are called
d) this pointer is passed with help of void pointer member functions are called
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: When an object calls some member function, it implicitly passes itself as an argument. This allows the compiler to know which member should be used for the purposes. This also allows to reduce the ambiguity among the variable and data member names.

3. The this pointer is accessible __________________
a) Within all the member functions of the class
b) Only within functions returning void
c) Only within non-static functions
d) Within the member functions with zero arguments
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The this pointer is available only within the non-static member functions of a class. If the member function is static, it will be common to all the objects and hence a single object cant refer to those functions independently.

4. An objects this pointer _____________________
a) Isnt part of class
b) Isnt part of program
c) Isnt part of compiler
d) Isnt part of object itself
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The objects this pointer being called are not part of the object itself. This can be cross verified by checking that it doesnt take up any space for the data to be stored or pointed.

5. The result of sizeof() function __________________
a) Includes space reserved for this pointer
b) Includes space taken up by the address pointer by this pointer
c) Doesnt include the space taken by this pointer
d) Doesnt include space for any data member
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The space taken by this pointer is not reflected in by the sizeof() operator. This is because objects this pointer is not part of object itself. This is a cross verification for the concept stating that this pointer doesnt take any space in the object.

6. Whenever non-static member functions are called _______________
a) Address of the object is passed implicitly as an argument
b) Address of the object is passed explicitly as an argument
c) Address is specified globally so that the address is not used again
d) Address is specified as return type of the function
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The address is passed implicitly as an argument to the function. This doesnt have to be passed explicitly. The address is passed, of the object which is calling the non-static member function.

7. Which is the correct interpretation of the member function call from an object, object.function(parameter);
a) object.function(&this, parameter)
b) object(&function,parameter)
c) function(&object,&parameter)
d) function(&object,parameter)
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The function name is specified first and then the parameter lists. The parameter list is included with the object name along with & symbol. This denotes that the address of the object is being passed as an argument.




8. The address of the object _________________
a) Cant be accessed from inside the function
b) Cant be accessed in the program
c) Is available inside the member function using this pointer
d) Can be accessed using the object name inside the member function
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The address of the object with respect to which the member functions are being called, are stored in this pointer. This pointer is hence used whenever there are members with same name as those of the variables inside the function.

9. Which among the following is true?
a) This pointer can be used to guard against any kind of reference
b) This pointer can be used to guard against self-reference
c) This pointer can be used to guard from other pointers
d) This pointer can be used to guard from parameter referencing
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The this pointer can be used to guard itself whenever self-reference is used. This allows accidental address access. And accidental modification of data.




10. Which syntax doesnt execute/is false when executed?
a) if(&object != this)
b) if(&function !=object)
c) this.if(!this)
d) this.function(!this)
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The condition becomes false when executed and hence doesnt executes. This is the case where this pointer can guard itself from the self-reference. Here if the address of the object doesnt match with this pointer that means the object doesnt refer itself.

11. The this pointers _____________________
a) Are modifiable
b) Can be assigned any value
c) Are made variables
d) Are non-modifiable
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The this pointer is non modifiable. This is because the address of any object remains constant throughout its life time. Hence the address must not be changed otherwise wrong members of invalid addresses might get accessed.

12. Earlier implementations of C++ ___________________
a) Never allowed assignment to this pointer
b) Allowed no assignment to this pointer
c) Allowed assignments to this pointer
d) Never allowed assignment to any pointer
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The earlier, most initial versions of C++ used to allow assignments to this pointers. That used to allow modifications of this pointer. Later that feature got disabled.

13. This pointer can be used directly to ___________
a) To manipulate self-referential data structures
b) To manipulate any reference to pointers to member functions
c) To manipulate class references
d) To manipulate and disable any use of pointers
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: This is a feature provided, that can be used directly. The manipulation of self-referential data structures is just an application of this feature. Other conditions fails as this pointer doesnt deal with those things.

14. Which among the following is/are type(s) of this pointer?
a) const
b) volatile
c) const or volatile
d) int
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The this pointer can be declared const or volatile. This depends on need of program and type of code. This is just an additional feature.

15. Which is the correct syntax for declaring the type of this in a member function?
a) classType [cv-qualifier-list] *const this;
b) classType const[cv-qualifier-list] *this;
c) [cv-qualifier-list]*const classType this;
d) [cv-qualifier-list] classType *const this;
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The syntax contains the cv-qualifier-list that can be determined from the member function declaratory that can be either const or volatile or can be made both. Hence we write it as list. classType denotes the name of class to mention to which class does the object belong to. And *const this denotes that the this pointer is having a constant value.

1. What is the length of DE if DE || BC and D and E are midpoints of AB and AC?
b) 15cm
c) 9cm
d) 20cm
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Since In ABC, D and E are midpoints of the sides AB and AC and DE || BC, by mid-point theorem, DE =  BC =  x 18 = 9cm.




2. Which of the following relation is correct if S is midpoint of PR?
b) QS =  PR
c) QS = 2PR
d) QS =  PR
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Draw ST || RQ meeting PQ at point T

STQ + TQR = 180 (Interior angles on the same side of transversal)
 STQ = 90
Also, Since ST || RQ and S is midpoint of PR, by midpoint theorem,
T is midpoint of PQ i.e. PT = TQ  (i)
and ST=  RQ
In PTS and TQS,
PT = TQ (from equation i)
PTS = STQ = 90
TS = TS (Common side)
Hence, PTS  TQS (by SAS congruence criterion)
 PS = QS (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)
But, PS =  PR (S is midpoint of PR)
 QS =  PR.

3. What is the ration of AC/CF if AD and BE are the median and DF || BE?
b) 1
c) 1/4
d) 1/2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Since In BEC, D is the midpoint of the BC and DF || BE, by mid-point theorem,
DF =  BE and
F is midpoint of EC i.e. EF = FC (i)
Also, AE = EC =  AC-(ii) (BE is median to side AC)
From i, CF =  EC
 CF =  ( AC) (from equation ii)
 CF =  AC.

6. Find the perimeter of ABC, if perimeter of PQR is 36cm and A, B and C are midpoints.
b) 18cm
c) 20cm
d) 36cm
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In PQR, A and B are the midpoints of the PQ and PR, by mid-point theorem,
AB || QR and AB =  QR  (i)
Similarly, A and C are the midpoints of the PQ and QR, by mid-point theorem,
AC || PR and AC =  PR  (i)
and B and C are the midpoints of the PR and QR, by mid-point theorem,
BC || PQ and BC =  PQ  (i)
Now, perimeter of ABC = AB + BC + AC
 perimeter of ABC =  QR +  PQ +  PR (from equation i, ii and iii)
 perimeter of ABC =  (QR + PQ + PR)
 perimeter of ABC =  (perimeter of PQR) =  x 36 = 18cm.

7. Find the ratio of the angles D : E : F of DEF formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of ABC.
b) 4 : 3 : 2
c) 2 : 3 : 5
d) 5 : 3 : 2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Since D, E and F are the midpoints of the sides AB, BC and AC of ABC, by mid-point theorem, DF || BC, DE || AC and FE || AB
As EF || AB and DF || BC,  EF || BD and DF || BE  DFEB is a parallelogram
 B = DFE = 60  (i) (Opposite angles of parallelogram are equal)
Similarly, As EF || AB and DE || AC,  EF || AD and DE || AF  AFED is a parallelogram
 A = DEF = 40 (ii) (Opposite angles of parallelogram are equal)
and as DE || AC and DF || BC,  DE || FC and DF || EC  DECF is a parallelogram
 C = EDF = 80  (iii) (Opposite angles of parallelogram are equal)
Now, D: E: F = 80 : 40 : 60 (from equation i,ii and iii)
 D: E: F = 4 : 2 : 3.




8. If ABCR and PQRS are rectangles and B is the midpoint of PR, find the ratio of AC/PR.
b) 2
c) 1
d) 5/2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In PSR, B is the midpoint of PR and AB || SP, by mid-point theorem,
A is midpoint of SR i.e. AS = AR  (i)
Similarly, in SRQ, A is the midpoint of SR and AC || SR, by mid-point theorem,
AC =  SQ and C is midpoint of RQ i.e. RC = CQ  (i)
Now, AC =  SQ
 AC =  PR (Diagonals of rectangle are equal)
 AC/PR = 1/2.

9. From the diagram below, if D and E are mid points of the lines AB and AC respectively and if DE  BC, then what is the relation between DE and BC?
b) 3DE = BC
c) 2DE = BC
d) There is no definite relation between DE and BC
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: According to mid-point theorem, if D and E are mid points of the lines AB and AC respectively and if DE  BC, then 2DE = BC.




10. From the diagram given below, if P, Q and R are mid points of sides AB, BC and AC respectively, then RQP is congruent to BDE, DAF and EFC.
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: P, Q and R are mid points of sides AB, BC and AC respectively (given).
Therefore, according to theorem 8.9, PQ  AC, QR  AB and PR  BC.
Hence, APQR, PBQR and PQCR are all parallelograms.
Now, PQ is the diagonal of the parallelogram PBQR. Therefore, according to theorem 8.1,
PQR is congruent to QPB.
Similarly, QR and RP are the diagonals of parallelograms PQCR and APQR respectively.
Therefore, PQR is congruent to CRQ and
PQR is congruent to RAP.

Pre-requisite for C Pointers and Function Arguments MCQ set: Video Tutorial on C Pointers.
############## https://www.sanfoundry.com/object-oriented-programming-questions-answers-pointer/
1. Which is the pointer which denotes the object calling the member function?
a) Variable pointer
b) This pointer
c) Null pointer
d) Zero pointer
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The pointer which denotes the object calling the member function is known as this pointer. The this pointer is usually used when there are members in the function with same name as those of the class members.




2. Which among the following is true?
a) this pointer is passed implicitly when member functions are called
b) this pointer is passed explicitly when member functions are called
c) this pointer is passed with help of pointer member functions are called
d) this pointer is passed with help of void pointer member functions are called
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: When an object calls some member function, it implicitly passes itself as an argument. This allows the compiler to know which member should be used for the purposes. This also allows to reduce the ambiguity among the variable and data member names.

3. The this pointer is accessible __________________
a) Within all the member functions of the class
b) Only within functions returning void
c) Only within non-static functions
d) Within the member functions with zero arguments
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The this pointer is available only within the non-static member functions of a class. If the member function is static, it will be common to all the objects and hence a single object cant refer to those functions independently.


    
Note: Join free Sanfoundry classes at Telegram or Youtube




4. An objects this pointer _____________________
a) Isnt part of class
b) Isnt part of program
c) Isnt part of compiler
d) Isnt part of object itself
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The objects this pointer being called are not part of the object itself. This can be cross verified by checking that it doesnt take up any space for the data to be stored or pointed.

5. The result of sizeof() function __________________
a) Includes space reserved for this pointer
b) Includes space taken up by the address pointer by this pointer
c) Doesnt include the space taken by this pointer
d) Doesnt include space for any data member
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The space taken by this pointer is not reflected in by the sizeof() operator. This is because objects this pointer is not part of object itself. This is a cross verification for the concept stating that this pointer doesnt take any space in the object.

6. Whenever non-static member functions are called _______________
a) Address of the object is passed implicitly as an argument
b) Address of the object is passed explicitly as an argument
c) Address is specified globally so that the address is not used again
d) Address is specified as return type of the function
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The address is passed implicitly as an argument to the function. This doesnt have to be passed explicitly. The address is passed, of the object which is calling the non-static member function.

7. Which is the correct interpretation of the member function call from an object, object.function(parameter);
a) object.function(&this, parameter)
b) object(&function,parameter)
c) function(&object,&parameter)
d) function(&object,parameter)
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The function name is specified first and then the parameter lists. The parameter list is included with the object name along with & symbol. This denotes that the address of the object is being passed as an argument.




8. The address of the object _________________
a) Cant be accessed from inside the function
b) Cant be accessed in the program
c) Is available inside the member function using this pointer
d) Can be accessed using the object name inside the member function
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The address of the object with respect to which the member functions are being called, are stored in this pointer. This pointer is hence used whenever there are members with same name as those of the variables inside the function.

9. Which among the following is true?
a) This pointer can be used to guard against any kind of reference
b) This pointer can be used to guard against self-reference
c) This pointer can be used to guard from other pointers
d) This pointer can be used to guard from parameter referencing
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The this pointer can be used to guard itself whenever self-reference is used. This allows accidental address access. And accidental modification of data.




10. Which syntax doesnt execute/is false when executed?
a) if(&object != this)
b) if(&function !=object)
c) this.if(!this)
d) this.function(!this)
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The condition becomes false when executed and hence doesnt executes. This is the case where this pointer can guard itself from the self-reference. Here if the address of the object doesnt match with this pointer that means the object doesnt refer itself.

11. The this pointers _____________________
a) Are modifiable
b) Can be assigned any value
c) Are made variables
d) Are non-modifiable
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The this pointer is non modifiable. This is because the address of any object remains constant throughout its life time. Hence the address must not be changed otherwise wrong members of invalid addresses might get accessed.

12. Earlier implementations of C++ ___________________
a) Never allowed assignment to this pointer
b) Allowed no assignment to this pointer
c) Allowed assignments to this pointer
d) Never allowed assignment to any pointer
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The earlier, most initial versions of C++ used to allow assignments to this pointers. That used to allow modifications of this pointer. Later that feature got disabled.

13. This pointer can be used directly to ___________
a) To manipulate self-referential data structures
b) To manipulate any reference to pointers to member functions
c) To manipulate class references
d) To manipulate and disable any use of pointers
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: This is a feature provided, that can be used directly. The manipulation of self-referential data structures is just an application of this feature. Other conditions fails as this pointer doesnt deal with those things.

14. Which among the following is/are type(s) of this pointer?
a) const
b) volatile
c) const or volatile
d) int
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The this pointer can be declared const or volatile. This depends on need of program and type of code. This is just an additional feature.

15. Which is the correct syntax for declaring the type of this in a member function?
a) classType [cv-qualifier-list] *const this;
b) classType const[cv-qualifier-list] *this;
c) [cv-qualifier-list]*const classType this;
d) [cv-qualifier-list] classType *const this;
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The syntax contains the cv-qualifier-list that can be determined from the member function declaratory that can be either const or volatile or can be made both. Hence we write it as list. classType denotes the name of class to mention to which class does the object belong to. And *const this denotes that the this pointer is having a constant value.

10. What happens if the following C++ statement is compiled and executed?
int *ptr = NULL;
delete ptr;
a) The program is not semantically correct
b) The program is compiled and executed successfully
c) The program gives a compile-time error
d) The program compiled successfully but throws an error during run-time
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The above statement is syntactically and semantically correct as C++ allows the programmer to delete a NULL pointer, therefore, the program is compiled and executed successfully.

11. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include <iostream> 
#include <string>
using namespace std; 
int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
}
a) Hello

Explanation: As the func(void) needs no argument during its call, hence when we are calling func(2) with 2 as passed as a parameter then this statement gives the error in both C++ and C compiler.

15. Which of the following is correct about this pointer in C++?
a) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all static variables of a class
b) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all the functions of a class
c) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all non-static functions of a class
d) this pointer is passed as a hidden argument in all static functions of a class
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: As static functions are a type of global function for a class so all the object shares the common instance of that static function whereas all the objects have there own instance for non-static functions and hence they are passed as a hidden argument in all the non-static members but not in static members.

16. What will be the output of the following C++ code?
    #include <iostream>    #include <string>    #include <algorithm>    using namespace std;    int main()     {        string s = "spaces in text";        s.erase(remove(s.begin(), s.end(), ' ' ), s.end() ) ;        cout << s << endl;    }
a) spacesintext
b) spaces in text
c) spaces
d) spaces in

Pre-requisite for C Pointers and Function Arguments MCQ set: Video Tutorial on C Pointers.
############## https://www.sanfoundry.com/object-oriented-programming-questions-answers-pointer/
1. Which is the pointer which denotes the object calling the member function?
a) Variable pointer
b) This pointer
c) Null pointer
d) Zero pointer
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The pointer which denotes the object calling the member function is known as this pointer. The this pointer is usually used when there are members in the function with same name as those of the class members.




2. Which among the following is true?
a) this pointer is passed implicitly when member functions are called
b) this pointer is passed explicitly when member functions are called
c) this pointer is passed with help of pointer member functions are called
d) this pointer is passed with help of void pointer member functions are called
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: When an object calls some member function, it implicitly passes itself as an argument. This allows the compiler to know which member should be used for the purposes. This also allows to reduce the ambiguity among the variable and data member names.

3. The this pointer is accessible __________________
a) Within all the member functions of the class
b) Only within functions returning void
c) Only within non-static functions
d) Within the member functions with zero arguments
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The this pointer is available only within the non-static member functions of a class. If the member function is static, it will be common to all the objects and hence a single object cant refer to those functions independently.

4. An objects this pointer _____________________
a) Isnt part of class
b) Isnt part of program
c) Isnt part of compiler
d) Isnt part of object itself
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The objects this pointer being called are not part of the object itself. This can be cross verified by checking that it doesnt take up any space for the data to be stored or pointed.

5. The result of sizeof() function __________________
a) Includes space reserved for this pointer
b) Includes space taken up by the address pointer by this pointer
c) Doesnt include the space taken by this pointer
d) Doesnt include space for any data member
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The space taken by this pointer is not reflected in by the sizeof() operator. This is because objects this pointer is not part of object itself. This is a cross verification for the concept stating that this pointer doesnt take any space in the object.

6. Whenever non-static member functions are called _______________
a) Address of the object is passed implicitly as an argument
b) Address of the object is passed explicitly as an argument
c) Address is specified globally so that the address is not used again
d) Address is specified as return type of the function
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The address is passed implicitly as an argument to the function. This doesnt have to be passed explicitly. The address is passed, of the object which is calling the non-static member function.

7. Which is the correct interpretation of the member function call from an object, object.function(parameter);
a) object.function(&this, parameter)
b) object(&function,parameter)
c) function(&object,&parameter)
d) function(&object,parameter)
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The function name is specified first and then the parameter lists. The parameter list is included with the object name along with & symbol. This denotes that the address of the object is being passed as an argument.




8. The address of the object _________________
a) Cant be accessed from inside the function
b) Cant be accessed in the program
c) Is available inside the member function using this pointer
d) Can be accessed using the object name inside the member function
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The address of the object with respect to which the member functions are being called, are stored in this pointer. This pointer is hence used whenever there are members with same name as those of the variables inside the function.

9. Which among the following is true?
a) This pointer can be used to guard against any kind of reference
b) This pointer can be used to guard against self-reference
c) This pointer can be used to guard from other pointers
d) This pointer can be used to guard from parameter referencing
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The this pointer can be used to guard itself whenever self-reference is used. This allows accidental address access. And accidental modification of data.




10. Which syntax doesnt execute/is false when executed?
a) if(&object != this)
b) if(&function !=object)
c) this.if(!this)
d) this.function(!this)
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The condition becomes false when executed and hence doesnt executes. This is the case where this pointer can guard itself from the self-reference. Here if the address of the object doesnt match with this pointer that means the object doesnt refer itself.

11. The this pointers _____________________
a) Are modifiable
b) Can be assigned any value
c) Are made variables
d) Are non-modifiable
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The this pointer is non modifiable. This is because the address of any object remains constant throughout its life time. Hence the address must not be changed otherwise wrong members of invalid addresses might get accessed.

12. Earlier implementations of C++ ___________________
a) Never allowed assignment to this pointer
b) Allowed no assignment to this pointer
c) Allowed assignments to this pointer
d) Never allowed assignment to any pointer
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The earlier, most initial versions of C++ used to allow assignments to this pointers. That used to allow modifications of this pointer. Later that feature got disabled.

13. This pointer can be used directly to ___________
a) To manipulate self-referential data structures
b) To manipulate any reference to pointers to member functions
c) To manipulate class references
d) To manipulate and disable any use of pointers
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: This is a feature provided, that can be used directly. The manipulation of self-referential data structures is just an application of this feature. Other conditions fails as this pointer doesnt deal with those things.

14. Which among the following is/are type(s) of this pointer?
a) const
b) volatile
c) const or volatile
d) int
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The this pointer can be declared const or volatile. This depends on need of program and type of code. This is just an additional feature.

15. Which is the correct syntax for declaring the type of this in a member function?
a) classType [cv-qualifier-list] *const this;
b) classType const[cv-qualifier-list] *this;
c) [cv-qualifier-list]*const classType this;
d) [cv-qualifier-list] classType *const this;
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The syntax contains the cv-qualifier-list that can be determined from the member function declaratory that can be either const or volatile or can be made both. Hence we write it as list. classType denotes the name of class to mention to which class does the object belong to. And *const this denotes that the this pointer is having a constant value.

1. What is the length of DE if DE || BC and D and E are midpoints of AB and AC?
b) 15cm
c) 9cm
d) 20cm
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: Since In ABC, D and E are midpoints of the sides AB and AC and DE || BC, by mid-point theorem, DE =  BC =  x 18 = 9cm.




2. Which of the following relation is correct if S is midpoint of PR?
b) QS =  PR
c) QS = 2PR
d) QS =  PR
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Draw ST || RQ meeting PQ at point T

STQ + TQR = 180 (Interior angles on the same side of transversal)
 STQ = 90
Also, Since ST || RQ and S is midpoint of PR, by midpoint theorem,
T is midpoint of PQ i.e. PT = TQ  (i)
and ST=  RQ
In PTS and TQS,
PT = TQ (from equation i)
PTS = STQ = 90
TS = TS (Common side)
Hence, PTS  TQS (by SAS congruence criterion)
 PS = QS (Corresponding parts of congruent triangles)
But, PS =  PR (S is midpoint of PR)
 QS =  PR.

3. What is the ration of AC/CF if AD and BE are the median and DF || BE?
b) 1
c) 1/4
d) 1/2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Since In BEC, D is the midpoint of the BC and DF || BE, by mid-point theorem,
DF =  BE and
F is midpoint of EC i.e. EF = FC (i)
Also, AE = EC =  AC-(ii) (BE is median to side AC)
From i, CF =  EC
 CF =  ( AC) (from equation ii)

6. Find the perimeter of ABC, if perimeter of PQR is 36cm and A, B and C are midpoints.
b) 18cm
c) 20cm
d) 36cm
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In PQR, A and B are the midpoints of the PQ and PR, by mid-point theorem,
AB || QR and AB =  QR  (i)
Similarly, A and C are the midpoints of the PQ and QR, by mid-point theorem,
AC || PR and AC =  PR  (i)
and B and C are the midpoints of the PR and QR, by mid-point theorem,
BC || PQ and BC =  PQ  (i)
Now, perimeter of ABC = AB + BC + AC
 perimeter of ABC =  QR +  PQ +  PR (from equation i, ii and iii)
 perimeter of ABC =  (QR + PQ + PR)
 perimeter of ABC =  (perimeter of PQR) =  x 36 = 18cm.

7. Find the ratio of the angles D : E : F of DEF formed by joining the midpoints of the sides of ABC.
b) 4 : 3 : 2
c) 2 : 3 : 5
d) 5 : 3 : 2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Since D, E and F are the midpoints of the sides AB, BC and AC of ABC, by mid-point theorem, DF || BC, DE || AC and FE || AB
As EF || AB and DF || BC,  EF || BD and DF || BE  DFEB is a parallelogram
 B = DFE = 60  (i) (Opposite angles of parallelogram are equal)
Similarly, As EF || AB and DE || AC,  EF || AD and DE || AF  AFED is a parallelogram
 A = DEF = 40 (ii) (Opposite angles of parallelogram are equal)
and as DE || AC and DF || BC,  DE || FC and DF || EC  DECF is a parallelogram
 C = EDF = 80  (iii) (Opposite angles of parallelogram are equal)
Now, D: E: F = 80 : 40 : 60 (from equation i,ii and iii)
 D: E: F = 4 : 2 : 3.




8. If ABCR and PQRS are rectangles and B is the midpoint of PR, find the ratio of AC/PR.
b) 2
c) 1
d) 5/2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In PSR, B is the midpoint of PR and AB || SP, by mid-point theorem,
A is midpoint of SR i.e. AS = AR  (i)
Similarly, in SRQ, A is the midpoint of SR and AC || SR, by mid-point theorem,
AC =  SQ and C is midpoint of RQ i.e. RC = CQ  (i)
Now, AC =  SQ
 AC =  PR (Diagonals of rectangle are equal)
 AC/PR = 1/2.

9. From the diagram below, if D and E are mid points of the lines AB and AC respectively and if DE  BC, then what is the relation between DE and BC?
b) 3DE = BC
c) 2DE = BC
d) There is no definite relation between DE and BC
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: According to mid-point theorem, if D and E are mid points of the lines AB and AC respectively and if DE  BC, then 2DE = BC.




10. From the diagram given below, if P, Q and R are mid points of sides AB, BC and AC respectively, then RQP is congruent to BDE, DAF and EFC.
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: P, Q and R are mid points of sides AB, BC and AC respectively (given).
Therefore, according to theorem 8.9, PQ  AC, QR  AB and PR  BC.
Hence, APQR, PBQR and PQCR are all parallelograms.
Now, PQ is the diagonal of the parallelogram PBQR. Therefore, according to theorem 8.1,
PQR is congruent to QPB.
Similarly, QR and RP are the diagonals of parallelograms PQCR and APQR respectively.
Therefore, PQR is congruent to CRQ and
PQR is congruent to RAP.
