7. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME when the algorithm analyzes: (()(())(()))?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 3 elements are there in stack before right parentheses comes. Therefore, maximum number of elements in stack at run time is 3.




8. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. Suppose that you run the algorithm on a sequence that contains 2 left parentheses and 3 right parentheses (in some order). The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME during the computation?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 2 left parenthesis are pushed whereas one right parenthesis removes one of left parenthesis. 2 elements are there before right parenthesis which is the maximum number of elements in stack at run time.

9. What is the value of the postfix expression 6 3 2 4 + � *?

a) difficulty in knowing children nodes of a node
b) difficult in finding the parent of a node
c) have to know the maximum number of nodes possible before creation of trees
d) difficult to implement
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: The size of array is fixed in normal arrays. We need to know the number of nodes in the tree before array declaration. It is the main disadvantage of using arrays to represent binary trees.

3. What must be the ideal size of array if the height of tree is �l�?
a) 2l-1
b) l-1
c) l
d) 2l
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Maximum elements in a tree (complete binary tree in worst case) of height �L� is 2L-1. Hence size of array is taken as 2L-1.

4. What are the children for node �w� of a complete-binary tree in an array representation?
a) 2w and 2w+1
b) 2+w and 2-w
c) w+1/2 and w/2
d) w-1/2 and w+1/2
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The left child is generally taken as 2*w whereas the right child will be taken as 2*w+1 because root node is present at index 0 in the array and to access every index position in the array.

5. What is the parent for a node �w� of a complete binary tree in an array representation when w is not 0?
a) floor(w-1/2)
b) ceil(w-1/2)
c) w-1/2

6. If the tree is not a complete binary tree then what changes can be made for easy access of children of a node in the array?
a) every node stores data saying which of its children exist in the array
b) no need of any changes continue with 2w and 2w+1, if node is at i
c) keep a seperate table telling children of a node
d) use another array parallel to the array with tree
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: Array cannot represent arbitrary shaped trees. It can only be used in case of complete trees. If every node stores data saying that which of its children exists in the array then elements can be accessed easily.

7. What must be the missing logic in place of missing lines for finding sum of nodes of binary tree in alternate levels?




  //e.g:-consider -complete binary tree:-height-3, [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]-answer must be 23
  {
        //present level is initialized to 1 and sum is initialized to  0
        {
        }
     //missing logic
  }
a)
b)
c)
d)
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: The i value must skip through all nodes in the next level and current level must be one+next level.
��
8. Consider a situation of writing a binary tree into a file with memory storage efficiency in mind, is array representation of tree is good?
a) yes because we are overcoming the need of pointers and so space efficiency
b) yes because array values are indexable
c) No it is not efficient in case of sparse trees and remaning cases it is fine
d) No linked list representation of tree is only fine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In case of sparse trees (where one node per level in worst cases), the array size (2h)-1 where h is height but only h indexes will be filled and (2h)-1-h nodes will be left unused leading to space wastage.

9. Why is heap implemented using array representations than tree(linked list) representations though both tree representations and heaps have same complexities?
for binary heap
-insert: O(log n)
-delete min: O(log n)
-insert: O(log n)
-delete: O(log n)
Then why go with array representation when both are having same values ?
a) arrays can store trees which are complete and heaps are not complete
b) lists representation takes more memory hence memory efficiency is less and go with arrays and arrays have better caching
c) lists have better caching
d) In lists insertion and deletion is difficult
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In memory the pointer address for next node may not be adjacent or nearer to each other and also array have wonderful caching power from os and manipulating pointers is a overhead. Heap data structure is always a complete binary tree.

10. Can a tree stored in an array using either one of inorder or post order or pre order traversals be again reformed?
a) Yes just traverse through the array and form the tree
b) No we need one more traversal to form a tree
c) No in case of sparse trees
d) Yes by using both inorder and array elements
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: We need any two traversals for tree formation but if some additional stuff or techniques are used while storing a tree in an array then one traversal can facilitate like also storing null values of a node in array.

1. How the keyword �TYPE� is used?
a) TYPE datatype_name IS type_from_predefined_datatypes;
b) TYPE datatype_name IS datatype_range;
c) TYPE datatype_range IS datatype_name;
d) USE TYPE datatype_range IS datatype_name;
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: The keyword TYPE is used to define new data type if any user wants to define for its own. The syntax for keyword is- TYPE datatype_name IS datatype_range. So, the new data type can have the values defined in range section of the declaration.




2. Which of the following is a wrong declaration for a new data type?
a) TYPE my_logic IS RANGE 0 to 100;
b) TYPE my_logic IS (�0�, �1�, �2�);
c) TYPE my_logic IS ARRAY (0 TO 3) OF BIT;
d) TYPE my_logic IS  <0 TO 20 >
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: TYPE can be used in three forms as shown above. For defining range, there are two methods as illustrated in option TYPE my_logic IS RANGE 0 to 100; and option TYPE my_logic IS (�0�, �1�, �2�);. If we want to define a user defined array then the sytanx like option TYPE my_logic IS ARRAY (0 TO 3) OF BIT; follows. But, we can�t define range by using <> sign.

3. One can�t define an array without any constraints in VHDL.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: We can define an array without any constraints in VHDL. When there are no constraints in array then it can have any number of elements. For example, TYPE my_type IS ARRAY (RANGE <>) OF BIT; this declaration defines an array of BIT data type without any constraint on the number of elements in the array.

4. A SUBTYPE can be defined as _________
a) A TYPE under a TYPE (nested)
b) A type of INTEGER datatype
c) A TYPE with some constraint
d) A TYPE without any constraint
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: A SUBTYPE is a TYPE with some constraints. TYPE can be predefined data type and it can also be any user defined data type. But if SUBTYPE is derived from user defined datatype, then we first have to declare the type along with its range and then subtype can be defined.

5. Which of the following is the correct syntax for declaring a SUBTYPE?
a) TYPE type_name IS type_range AND SUBTYPE subtype_name IS subtype_range
b) SUBTYPE subtype_name IS subtype_range TYPE type_name
c) SUBTYPE subtype_name TYPE type_name IS subtype_range
d) SUBTYPE subtype_name IS TYPE subtype_range
View AnswerAnswer: d
Explanation: The correct way to define a SUBTYPE is the syntax shown in option d. For example, if we want to define a SUBTYPE of STD_LOGIC with 3 values only like X, 0 and 1. We can define it as SUBTYPE my _ subtype IS STD_LOGIC RANGE �X� TO �1�.

6. Which of the following can�t be the value of x? Refer to the VHDL code given below.
TYPE color IS (red, green, blue, black, white, gray);
SUBTYPE primary IS color RANGE red to blue;
VARIABLE x: primary;
a) White
b) Red
c) Green
d) Blue
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: PRIMARY is a subtype of COLOR as declared in the code. The range of PRIMARY is declared �red� to �blue�. It means that an object of Primary type can have values red, green or blue. So White can�t be assigned to x.




7. Look at the following declarations:




TYPE array1 IS ARRAY ( 0 TO 3 ) OF BIT_VECTOR (3 DOWNTO 0 ); 
TYPE array 2 IS ARRAY ( 0 TO 3 ) OF array1;
How many total bits can be stored in these arrays?
a) 16
b) 9
c) 64
d) 27
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: First of all, array1 is array of BIT_VECTOR type that means it contains 4 BIT_VECTOR. One BIT_VECTOR is here declared to be consisting of 4 bits. Therefore, Array 1 can have 16 bits. Now, array2 is an array of 4 array1. Therefore, total bits are 4 � 16 = 64.

8. Refer to the four declarations below, which of the following is not a 2 dimensional array?
TYPE array1 IS ARRAY ( 3 DOWNTO 0, 1 DOWNTO 0 ) OF STD_LOGIC;
TYPE array2 IS ARRAY (3 DOWNTO 0 ) OF STD_LOGIC_VECTOR( 3 DOWNTO 0 );
TYPE array3 IS ARRAY (2 DOWNTO 0 )  OF array2;
TYPE array4 IS ARRAY ( 0 TO 3, 3 DOWNTO 0 ) OF BIT;
a) array4
b) array3
c) array2
d) array1
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: Here, array1 is a 2-D array with 4 rows and 2 columns (3 DOWNTO 0 and 1 DOWNTO 0) of STD_LOGIC type. Though, array2 declaration looks like 1D array, but it is 2D array, since it is of type STD_LOGIC_VECTOR, which is already a 1D array, so array2 is a 2D array. Similarly array4 is 4 � 4 matrix. But, array3 is a 3D array. Because it is 1D array of 2D array named as array2.

9. User can define its own integer data type.
a) True
b) False
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: In VHDL, user can define either its own integer type or enumerated type. User defined integer type must always be a subset of predefined datatype. User can define the integer with some desired range. For example, we can define any integer named as my_integer with range 0 to 32 as given: TYPE my_integer IS RANGE 0 TO 32; in this way, one can define a subset of integer.

10. Which of the following is a SUBTYPE of INTEGER?
a) NATURAL
b) REAL
c) CHARACTER
d) STD_LOGIC
View AnswerAnswer: a
Explanation: We can say that NATURAL is a subtype of  INTEGER. The range of NATURAL datatype is 0 to 231-1, whereas the range of INTEGER is � (231-1) to (231-1). Therefore, it can be written as SUBTYPE NATURAL IS INTEGER RANGE 0 TO 2147483647.

a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 3 elements are there in stack before right parentheses comes. Therefore, maximum number of elements in stack at run time is 3.




8. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. Suppose that you run the algorithm on a sequence that contains 2 left parentheses and 3 right parentheses (in some order). The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME during the computation?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 2 left parenthesis are pushed whereas one right parenthesis removes one of left parenthesis. 2 elements are there before right parenthesis which is the maximum number of elements in stack at run time.

d) No linked list representation of tree is only fine
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In case of sparse trees (where one node per level in worst cases), the array size (2h)-1 where h is height but only h indexes will be filled and (2h)-1-h nodes will be left unused leading to space wastage.

9. Why is heap implemented using array representations than tree(linked list) representations though both tree representations and heaps have same complexities?
for binary heap
-insert: O(log n)
-delete min: O(log n)
-insert: O(log n)
-delete: O(log n)
Then why go with array representation when both are having same values ?
a) arrays can store trees which are complete and heaps are not complete
b) lists representation takes more memory hence memory efficiency is less and go with arrays and arrays have better caching
c) lists have better caching
d) In lists insertion and deletion is difficult
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In memory the pointer address for next node may not be adjacent or nearer to each other and also array have wonderful caching power from os and manipulating pointers is a overhead. Heap data structure is always a complete binary tree.

10. Can a tree stored in an array using either one of inorder or post order or pre order traversals be again reformed?
a) Yes just traverse through the array and form the tree
b) No we need one more traversal to form a tree
c) No in case of sparse trees
d) Yes by using both inorder and array elements

7. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME when the algorithm analyzes: (()(())(()))?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: c
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 3 elements are there in stack before right parentheses comes. Therefore, maximum number of elements in stack at run time is 3.




8. Consider the usual algorithm for determining whether a sequence of parentheses is balanced. Suppose that you run the algorithm on a sequence that contains 2 left parentheses and 3 right parentheses (in some order). The maximum number of parentheses that appear on the stack AT ANY ONE TIME during the computation?
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4 or more
View AnswerAnswer: b
Explanation: In the entire parenthesis balancing method when the incoming token is a left parenthesis it is pushed into stack. A right parenthesis makes pop operation to delete the elements in stack till we get left parenthesis as top most element. 2 left parenthesis are pushed whereas one right parenthesis removes one of left parenthesis. 2 elements are there before right parenthesis which is the maximum number of elements in stack at run time.

9. What is the value of the postfix expression 6 3 2 4 + � *?
