# Semester 8 - Automated Context Processing in Virtual Meeting

## 1. There are 2 major components of the project, namely the frontend and the backend

## 2. We are required to start both of them on different terminals/servers on our local computer
  
  ### Open a terminal and go into the frontend folder and run
  ```
  npm i
  ng serve
  ```
  This will start your frontend and you can view it on http://localhost:4200
  
  ### Next open another terminal and go into the backend and run
  ```
  pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
  py app.py
  ```
  This will start your flask server 


## 3. Open your broswer and go to http://localhost:4200
The project will be up and running, we can upload videos for processing
