WHAT IS A DATA TYPE?
Two important things about data types:
1. Defines a certain domain of values.
2. Defines Operations allowed on those values.
EXAMPLE:
ï¿½int type :
>. Taklls only integer values
Operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, bitwise operations etc.

USER DEFINED DATA TYPES
In contrast to primitive data types, there is a concept of user defined data
types.
The operations and values of user defined data types are not specified in the
language itself but is spltcified by the user.

[161.9,216.0]
ABSTRACT DATA TYPES (ADT)
AOTs are like user defined data types which defines operations on values
using functions without specifying what is there inside the function and how
the opewltions are performed.

ABSTRACT DATA TYPES (ADT)
Think of ADT as a black box which hides the inner structure and design of the
data type from the user. w

Wuy ADT?
The program which uses data structure is called a client program
It has access to the AOT i.e. interface.
The program which implements the data structure is known as the
implementation.
PND NN BY Nc) at
Let say, if someone wants to use the stack in the program, then he can simply
use push and pop operations without knowing its implementation.

CONCLUSION
ADT PROVIDES ABSTRACTION.
