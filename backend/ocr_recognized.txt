 WHAT IS A DATA TYPE?
Two important Things about data types:
1. Defines o certain domain of values.
2. Defines Operations allowed on those values.
EXAMPLE:
3 int type
3 - Takgs only integer values
- Operations: addition, subtraction,
multiplication, bitwise operations etc.

 USER DEF|NED DATA TYPES
JU
In contrast to primitive data types, there is a concept of user defined data
types.
The operations and values of user defined data types are not specified in the
language itself but is specified by the user.
EXAMPLE: Structure. union and enumeration.
By using structures, we are defining our own type by combining other data
types.
struct point {
int x;
int y;
};

 ABSTRACT DATA TYPES (ADT)
ADTs are like user defined data types which defines operations on values
using functions without specifying what is there inside the function and how
the operations are performed.
EXAMPLE: Stack ADT
A stock consists of elements of same type arranged in a sequential order.
Operations:
initia1ize() - initializing it to be empty
Push() ó Insert an element into the stack . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..
Pow) - Delete an element from the stack  only BLuEpR|NT
isEmpty() - checks if stack is empty ' - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
isFu11() ó checks if stack is full

 ABSTRACT DATA TYPES (ADT)
Think of ADT as a black box which hides The inner structure and design of The
dafo Type from The user.
JU

 \X/HY ADT?
The program which uses data structure is called a client program
It has access to the ADT i.e. interface.
The program which implements the data structure is known as the
implementation.
ADVANTAGE
Let say, if someone wants to use the stack in the program, then he can simply
use push and pop operations without knowing its implementation.
