 WHAT IS A WILD POINTER?
Wild pointers are also known as uninitialized pointers.
These pointers usually point to some arbitrary memory location and
may cause a program to crash or misbehave.
EXAMPLE:
int main()
{
int *p;
3? = 18;
eturne;

 How TO AVOID WILD pomreas?
2_ \) Explicifly allocate The memory and put the values in The allocated
memory.
EXAMPLE:
3
int main ( )
{
int *p = (int *)mal1oc(s:i.zeof(int));
*1! = 16;
free(p);
return 0;
